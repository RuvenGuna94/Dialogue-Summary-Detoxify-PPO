    "In this notebook, you will fine-tune a FLAN-T5 model to generate less toxic content with Meta AI's hate speech reward model. The reward model is a binary classifier that predicts either \"not hate\" or \"hate\" for the given text. You will use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to fine-tune and reduce the model's toxicity.\n",
